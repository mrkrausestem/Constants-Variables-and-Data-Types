# Constants--Variables--and-Data-Types
 
This lab will walk you through the creation of an exercise app.  The labs will continue to come back to this concept several times.  

Make sure you note that there are multiple pages in these labs.  The links on the bottom will move you through the lab.

Save your lab IN THE FINAL STATE based on the instructions provided.  If you are particularly clever, you can use the check in functionality within github to save multiple states, if the lab calls for them.  This is not a requirement, but can be helpful in crystalizing your understanding of change management.
