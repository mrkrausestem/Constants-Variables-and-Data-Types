/*:
 ## App Exercise - Mathematical constants
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a math tutor application.

 Your app needs to declare several more constants, declare constants 'e', and 'phi' and set their value to appropriately to 3 decimal places. (.5 point)
 */


/*:
 Use two `print` functions to print two lines to the console. The first line should say "The natural base, e, has the value:" and then print the value, and the second line should print the value of `phi` by referencing your constant. (.5 point)
