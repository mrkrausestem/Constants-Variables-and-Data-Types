 ## Exercise - Type Inference and Required Values
 
 Declare a variable called `name` of type `String`, but do not give it a value. Print `name` to the console. Does the code compile? Remove any code that will not compile. (.25 points)

/*:
 Now assign a value to `name`, and print it to the console. (.25 points)

/*:
 Declare a variable called `percentCorrect` and set it to 50. Do not give it an explicit type. (.25 points)
 */


/*:
 Now assign a value of 54.3 to `percentCorrect`. Does the code compile? Go back and set an explicit type on `percentCorrect` so the code will compile. (.25 points)
