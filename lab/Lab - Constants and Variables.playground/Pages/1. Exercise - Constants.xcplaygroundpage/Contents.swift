 ## Exercise - Constants
 
 - Note:
 We use 'let' to declare constants, 'var' to declare mutable variables.
 \
 IF THE LAB ASKS A QUESTION, MAKE SURE YOU RESPOND IN A PRINT STATEMENT
 
 Declare a constant called 'pi' to represent the ration of a circle's radius to its circumference. Set it to the correct value, to 3 decimal places. (.25 points)
 */


/*:
 Your teacher tells you that you need to use more decimal places at the STEM Academy, update your variable below to reflect 5 decimal places of pi. (.25 points)
 */


/*:
 Does the above code compile? Why not? Print your explanation to the console using the `print` function.
 Go back and comment out // your line of code that updates the `pi` constant so that the playground will compile properly. (.5 point)
