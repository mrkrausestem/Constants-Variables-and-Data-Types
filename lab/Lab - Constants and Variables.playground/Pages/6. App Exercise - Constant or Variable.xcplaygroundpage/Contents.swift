/*:
 ## App Exercise - More Constant or Variable?
 
 There are all sorts of things that your app needs to keep track of in order to display the right information to the user. Similar to the last exercise, declare either a constant or a variable for each of the following items, and assign each a sensible value. Be sure to use proper naming conventions.
 
 - Name: The user's name
 - Age: The user's age
 - Goal number of questions: The user's goal for number of questions to take each day
 - Progress tracker: Records the current level of the user
 */





/*:
 Now go back and add a line after each constant or variable declaration. On those lines, print a statement explaining why you chose to declare the piece of information as a constant or variable. (1 point)
