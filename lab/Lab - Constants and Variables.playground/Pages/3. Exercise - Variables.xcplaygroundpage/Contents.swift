 ## Exercise - Variables
 
 >The following includes an example of camelCase, which is appropriate to use in the naming of variables. On your projects, you will lose style points if camelCase
 and other appropriate style conventions are not followed.
 
 Declare a variable `gradeLevel` and set it to the number of years of school that you have completed. Print `gradeLevel` to the console. (.25 points)
 */


/*:
 Now imagine you just completed an additional year of school, and update the `schooling` variable accordingly. Print `schooling` to the console. (.25 points)
 */


/*:
 Does the above code compile? Why is this different than trying to update a constant? Print your explanation to the console using the `print` function. (.5 points)
